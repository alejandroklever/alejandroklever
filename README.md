# Hi there, everyone 👋

I'm Alejandro Klever, a Mobile Engineer with over 5 years of experience specializing in cross-platform mobile development and native iOS apps. I have a strong passion for building seamless, high-performance applications, from mobile apps to cloud-connected AR experiences.

Currently, I work on advanced mobile software including applications for the Apple Vision Pro, using Swift, SwiftUI, Flutter, and backend technologies like Django and Laravel. I've developed solutions for healthcare, fintech, and education sectors, always with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.

## About me

My journey into software development started at the University of Havana, where I was lucky to study under brilliant mentors and became an assistant professor in Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

After migrating to the United States in 2021, I embraced new opportunities, joining teams like Educup and TD Bank, and diving deeper into AR and AI app development for healthcare. Today, I'm focused on delivering high-impact solutions, constantly learning, and helping others grow along the way.

I believe good code is not just functional — it's empathetic to the user and maintainable for future developers.

## Believes and thoughts

- ❤️ I believe in goodness. If you have the necessary conditions to help someone, then being good is a duty.

- ❤️ Nothing is free and it is our duty to know when to make the sacrifices to move forward in our search for happiness.

- ❤️ I really stand for free speech. Everyone should have the chance to express themselves, consider the consequences of their words, and change their mind if they realize that they were wrong.

- ❤️ Respect is not acceptance, we can disagree but collaborate, even have a friendship.

- ❤️ Forgiveness is hard but it cleans our souls.

- ❤️ I had good mentors who taught me to love what I do. That’s why I love to teach others with the same passion.
