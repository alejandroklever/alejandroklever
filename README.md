## About me

I'm a programmer by day and a guitar player by night. I started both disciplines in Cuba, one in the halls of the University of Havana, where I knew the two best professors I ever had, Alejandro Piad and Alfredo Somoza, and the other in the streets of Havana, where I learned my brothers from different mothers.

I came to the United States to continue my studies, seek freedom, and build my future on this land.

In my free time, I mostly learn about new technologies and frameworks, try to solve challenging programming problems, create personal projects or contribute to others, and record songs in my room.

## Believes and thoughts

- ❤️ I believe in goodness. If you have the necessary conditions to help someone, then being good is a duty.

- ❤️ Nothing is free and it is our duty to know when to make the sacrifices to move forward in our search for happiness.

- ❤️ I really stand for free speech. Everyone should have the chance to express themselves, consider the consequences of their words, and change their mind if they realize that they were wrong.

- ❤️ Respect is not acceptance, we can disagree but collaborate, even have a friendship.

- ❤️ Forgiveness is hard but it cleans our souls.

- ❤️ I had good mentors who taught me to love what I do. That’s why I love to teach others with the same passion.
