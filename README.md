## About me

My path in software development began with a Computer Science degree at the University of Havana in 2016. There, I studied under excellent professors who instilled in me a great passion for mathematics, programming, and teaching. I had the honor of being a student assistant in my third year of study in Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

Right at the end of my third year of college, I had the opportunity to work as a mobile developer for the startup EducUp. We developed the e-learning app of the same name, which currently has more than 2 million active users.

In 2021, I came to the United States in search of new opportunities, freedom, and a place to call home. In this new stage of my life, I had the opportunity to work at TD Bank as a Pega Developer and Analyst. Thus, I obtained a better understanding of working in big tech companies related to finance, which gave me greater discipline when working with several large teams during digital product development.

I am starting a career as a freelancer, and although I don't know what destiny holds for me, I have faith that it will be prosperous.

## Believes and thoughts

- ❤️ I believe in goodness. If you have the necessary conditions to help someone, then being good is a duty.

- ❤️ Nothing is free and it is our duty to know when to make the sacrifices to move forward in our search for happiness.

- ❤️ I really stand for free speech. Everyone should have the chance to express themselves, consider the consequences of their words, and change their mind if they realize that they were wrong.

- ❤️ Respect is not acceptance, we can disagree but collaborate, even have a friendship.

- ❤️ Forgiveness is hard but it cleans our souls.

- ❤️ I had good mentors who taught me to love what I do. That’s why I love to teach others with the same passion.
